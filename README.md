# Wave_PostgreSQL_Challenge
Preamble: For each question, please write a SQL query that would answer it (you can assume a relatively recent version of PostgreSQL, although the exact version shouldn’t matter). And if you’d like, feel free to also include any notes or comments you have about the question if it would help us understand your thought process!
